# FaceID_system

In this project I implemented Face ID using Siamese Neural Networks. <br>

For this project, I used Siamese Neural Networks. These NNs can find the distance between to things and say whether they are the same of not! <br>

In this case, the NN can find the distance between 2 images and work as a face ID system. 


## Face ID app:
in the folder you can see the source of the face ID application that I created with Kivy. <br>
